## Scripts

The Preprocessing.r file prepares the dataset for the later analyses. The FDA.r file does the actual FDA work.

## Plots

The plot files includes the plots generated by the FDA.r file. The plots generated by first 3 steps(Processing, Smoothing, Landmark registration) are grouped into separate folders.
In the last step, FDA, FDA\_general includes plots for PCs and reconstructions that apply to all classes. Specific plots generated by each class(intonation, focus, structure) are saved in 3 separate folders.
